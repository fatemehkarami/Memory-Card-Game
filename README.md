# Memory Card Game
The Memory Card Game is a React-based web application that simulates the classic memory card matching game. Players are presented with a grid of face-down cards. When they click on a card, it flips over to reveal an image. Players need to find the matching pair by flipping two cards at a time. The game ends when all pairs are successfully matched.
